## Features

- `HasBattery()`: Checks if the system has a battery.

### âš¡ Battery Level
- `GetBatteryLevel()`: Retrieves the current battery percentage.  
  - Returns `100%` if plugged in.  
  - Returns `-1` if no battery is detected.

### ðŸ”Œ Charging State
- `IsCharging()`: Determines whether the device is currently charging.


### ðŸ’¹ Charging State
- `IsCharging()`: Determines whether the device is currently charging.


## Example Usage in C++

```cpp
#include "BatteryUtility.h"

void ExampleUsage()
{
    if (UBatteryUtility::HasBattery())
    {
        int32 BatteryLevel = UBatteryUtility::GetBatteryLevel();
        bool bIsCharging = UBatteryUtility::IsCharging();

        UE_LOG(LogTemp, Log, TEXT("Battery Level: %d%%"), BatteryLevel);
        UE_LOG(LogTemp, Log, TEXT("Charging: %s"), bIsCharging ? TEXT("Yes") : TEXT("No"));
    }
    else
    {
        UE_LOG(LogTemp, Log, TEXT("No battery detected."));
