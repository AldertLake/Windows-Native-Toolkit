# Open And Check Apps Feature (c++ & Blueprint)

The **Open And Check Apps Feature** module in Windows Native Toolkit allows Unreal Engine developers to open apps with `.exe` extantions and check if they are running or not.

## Features

### üî¢ Open An Apps By Path
- `OpenApps()`: Run an app with `.exe` extantion.

### üîõ Check If App Is Running
- `IsAppRunning()`: Retrieves if the app process is running or not.  

## Example Usage in C++

```cpp
#include "OpenApps.h"
#include "Engine/Engine.h"

void TestOpenApps()
{
    FString AppPath = TEXT("C:\\Windows\\System32\\notepad.exe");
    
    // Attempt to open Notepad
    bool bOpened = UOpenApps::OpenApps(AppPath);
    UE_LOG(LogTemp, Log, TEXT("Open Notepad: %s"), bOpened ? TEXT("Success") : TEXT("Failed"));
    
    // Check if Notepad is running
    bool bIsRunning = UOpenApps::IsAppRunning(AppPath);
    UE_LOG(LogTemp, Log, TEXT("Is Notepad Running: %s"), bIsRunning ? TEXT("Yes") : TEXT("No"));
}

// Call this function in your game mode, actor, or any suitable UE5 location (e.g., BeginPlay)
void AMyActor::BeginPlay()
{
    Super::BeginPlay();
    TestOpenApps();
}


```
